ðŸš€ **Excel Data Analysis Project: Strategic Insights for a Supermarket Chain** ðŸ“Š

For the project at the end of the "Excel Data Analysis" module, I developed a comprehensive dashboard using raw data from a supermarket chain. The goal was to derive strategic insights to enhance the company's profitability.

ðŸ“‹ **Dashboard Summary:**

- **Overall KPIs**: I examined metrics reflecting the company's overall performance. I summarized key KPIs such as profit, cost, total orders, and total sales. I also calculated the top 10 countries with the highest sales and visualized it using various charts.

- **Regional Analysis**: I detailed regional sales performance by analyzing sales volume, profit/loss, and total orders across regions like LATAM, US, and EU.

- **Product-Based Analysis**: I analyzed metrics such as profit/loss status, unit shipping cost, sales volume, and profit/loss by product categories.

The data and insights obtained from this project can assist the supermarket chain in making strategic decisions to enhance its profitability. Analyzing such data during the training process significantly contributed to the development of my real-world application skills.
